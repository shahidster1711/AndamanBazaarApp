**Issues Found:**
- 2 issues with color contrast in dark mode
- 1 issue with focus indicator visibility on custom components

**Recommendations:**
1. Adjust color contrast ratios for dark mode elements
2. Enhance focus indicators on custom interactive components
3. Add skip navigation links for screen readers

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### High Priority Issues
1. **CSRF Protection Missing** - All forms lack CSRF tokens
2. **Rate Limiting Insufficient** - API endpoints vulnerable to abuse
3. **Input Validation Weak** - Some endpoints accept oversized payloads

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Security Headers Missing** - Some security headers not configured
2. **Session Management** - Session tokens could be more secure
3. **File Upload Validation** - Limited file type validation

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Information Disclosure** - Some error messages reveal system information
2. **Clickjacking Protection** - Missing X-Frame-Options header
3. **Content Security Policy** - CSP header not implemented

## Recommendations and Action Items

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Security Headers** - Configure all security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
2. **Session Security** - Implement secure session management
3. **File Upload Security** - Add comprehensive file type and size validation

### Medium-term Actions (1 month)
1. **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching strategies and CDN
2. **Accessibility Improvements** - Fix color contrast and focus indicators
3. **Load Testing** - Scale infrastructure to handle 1000+ concurrent users

### Long-term Actions (3 months)
1. **Security Audit** - Conduct third-party security penetration testing
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement real user monitoring (RUM)
3. **Compliance Certification** - Obtain security compliance certifications
